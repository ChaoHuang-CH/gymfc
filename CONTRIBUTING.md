## Code Contributions
Please following these steps in order to have your contribution considered by
the maintainers.

1) Search through the issues to verify your code changes have not already been
discussed. 
2) Open an issue on Github outlining the changes you would like to make. Scope
each issue to a single change. If there are multiple changes you'd like to
make, open an issue for each one. The issue serves as the location for
documenting the change to be made. There will exist a one-to-one mapping between
an issue and a pull request. Once the change is approved continue to the
next step.
2) If you haven't already done so, fork the gymfc repository.
2) Create a branch named `i[issue number]-brief-description` where `[issue
number]` is the issue number previously created and `brief-description` is a
brief description of the change you are making. For example `i45-contribution`.

3) Make changes on your new branch. Follow the projects coding style and
 test you code changes. Double check your commits to ensure
unnecessary commits are not being to keep the commit history clean. 

4) When you are happy with the code changes open up a pull request. Specify the
issue the PR closes, for example `Closes: #45`. When the PR is merged, this keyword will automatically close the corresponding issue. 
Please provide testing results that will affect your code changes. A number of
testing scripts already exist in /test that may help.
